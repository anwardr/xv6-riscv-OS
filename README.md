# CISC-324 Operating System Lab

In this course, we will use the `xv6-riscv` operating system as our core operating system. You'll work directly with its source code to understand operating system concepts in practice.

## Getting Started

Please refer to the [setup guide](setup-xv6-riscv.md) for detailed instructions on installing and running xv6-riscv on your system.

Once you have completed the setup, come back here to understand how the lab materials are organized:

## How the lab will be structured

The lab materials are organized as follows:
- Lab instructions and assignments will be posted on OnQ
- You will complete your work by modifying the OS source code in this directory
- Additional resources and documentation will be distributed as needed throughout the term

## A brief introduction to xv6-riscv

xv6-riscv is an educational operating system developed by MIT for teaching operating system concepts. It's a modern reimplementation of Unix V6 using RISC-V architecture, making it an excellent learning tool for understanding OS fundamentals.

Key features and advantages:

- Clean, minimal codebase that's easy to understand
- Well-documented implementation of core OS concepts
- Practical platform for experimenting with OS modifications
- Modern architecture support (RISC-V)

The original xv6 was created by Frans Kaashoek, Robert Morris, and Russ Cox, with the RISC-V port developed by the MIT PDOS group. Special thanks to all contributors who maintain this valuable educational resource.

## What is RISC-V?

RISC-V is an open-source instruction set architecture (ISA) based on reduced instruction set computing (RISC) principles. It's designed to be simple, extensible, and suitable for a wide range of applications, from embedded systems to supercomputers.
